# 🔍 Network Scan & Packet Analysis – Internship Task

This project is part of a cybersecurity internship focused on basic network reconnaissance using **Nmap** and **Wireshark**.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- **Nmap**: To scan local IP range and identify open ports.
- **Wireshark**: To capture and analyze network packets.
- **PowerShell** on Windows 10 for command execution.

## 📡 Key Steps
1. Installed Nmap and verified setup.
2. Identified IP range using `ipconfig`.
3. Ran TCP SYN scan: `nmap -sS 192.168.1.0/24`
4. Captured packets using Wireshark.
5. Analyzed open ports and external connections.

## ✅ Outcome
Gained practical experience in scanning, analyzing, and reporting network vulnerabilities.
